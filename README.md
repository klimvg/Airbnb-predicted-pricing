This project is focused on creating a machine-learning model to predict Airbnb prices across different countries in Europe. 
The dataset includes 20 CSV files containing information about each Airbnb listing.
Various machine learning model-building techniques were used such as features correlation matrix and random forest regressor.
The model in the research appears to be successful with some room to grow which is described in the notebook.

The project is located in this repository's "index.ipynb" file.
